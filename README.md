# Face Detection and count

Face Detection Project
This project utilizes OpenCV's Haar cascades to perform face detection on both images and real-time video streams. Two main functions are implemented for this purpose:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
How to Use:
Image Face Detection:

Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the actual path to the image file you want to process.
Run the script.
A window will appear displaying the input image with detected faces outlined in green.
Real-time Video Face Detection:

Ensure your camera is connected and accessible.
Run the script.
A window will open showing the real-time video stream from your camera.
Detected faces will be outlined in green, and the number of detected faces will be displayed in the top left corner of the window.
Press 'Esc' key to exit the video stream.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different Haar cascade files for specific object detection tasks. Enjoy exploring the world of computer vision!
